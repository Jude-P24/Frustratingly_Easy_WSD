# Frustratingly Easy WSD

### Abstract
Accurate interpretation of medical abbreviations is essential for clinical decision-making since most clinical text from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are unstructured and often contain ambiguous abbreviations without the long forms or expansions. A simple approach for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) for medical abbreviations is presented in this research. By calculating the odds ratio of word tokens surrounding ambiguous abbreviations with their potential expansions, our method constructed a knowledge dictionary from a large medical text corpus. The knowledge dictionary is used to rank the possible expansions or Most Informative Forms (MIFs). Using the NCBI Disease Corpus test set we constructed a set of sentences with ambiguous abbreviations, which we used to evaluate our approach, as well as traditional machine learning (SVM) and deep learning (BERT) models. The results show that our most capable odds ratios approach, despite its simplicity of using a single word in the disambiguation process, achieved an accuracy of 0.821, which is close to the SVM (0.868) and BERT (0.892) models. This study highlights the potential of using a simple and interpretable method for WSD tasks in fields where precision is crucial.
